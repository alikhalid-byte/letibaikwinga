            <p>As much as I can talk about Leti for a whole year even write a book about my experience with her.
                <br>
                She is the perfect definition of <strong>ineffable</strong>
                <br>
                I am so lucky to have her in my life I believe all her friends are too.
                <br>
                She's one of those people that you never forget.Her personality just lights up the world.
                <br>
                Mostly mine.
                <br>
                She's caring, little mean but its cute , a good older sister or as she has said before <em>co parent</em>
                <br>
                She's a good person and someone you can expect to be there for you no matter what even if she has to sacrifice her comfortability.
                <br>
                Just that sums up what a pure soul she is.
                <br>
                <strong>Live love Leti</strong>
                <br>
                She's also superrrrr hilarious
